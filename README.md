# Restaurant QR Ordering — Server

A web app for a single restaurant where a guest scans the QR code on their
table, browses the menu, and orders dishes. The kitchen receives dishes and
updates their status, the cashier finalizes the bill and payment, and the admin
manages the menu, tables, and reports.

This repository is built on a **harness** operating model: agents read the
product contract, classify the work, and produce proof before changing code.
The app is what users touch; the harness is what agents touch.

## How This Repo Works

Before changing code, an agent answers practical questions from durable docs
rather than chat history: what to read first, what kind of work this is, which
product contract it affects, how risky it is, and what proof shows it is done.

Those answers live in:

- `AGENTS.md` — agent shim with local project notes and harness doc links.
- `docs/HARNESS.md` — the human-agent collaboration model.
- `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md` — tiny / normal / high-risk work classification.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — architecture discovery and boundary rules.
- `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` — behavior-to-proof validation expectations.
- `docs/stories/` — story packets and backlog.
- `docs/decisions/` — durable decisions and tradeoffs.
- `docs/templates/` — reusable spec, story, decision, and validation templates.

The durable layer (intake records, decisions, and the per-story test matrix) is
managed with the Rust Harness CLI at `scripts/bin/harness-cli`:

```bash
scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix          # per-story proof status
scripts/bin/harness-cli query tools --status present
```

A typical flow: product spec → product contract → feature intake → story packet
→ validation expectations → implementation → decision captured for future work.

## Current State

The spec (`SPEC.md`) has been decomposed into product docs, story packets, and
an architecture decision. The first backend buildout is sliced as epics
**E01-E10** and the durable story matrix is the current control panel.

Implemented backend slices include:

- **E01-E05 customer ordering loop:** project scaffold, Neon/Drizzle schema and
  migrations, QR table resolution, menu browse, order submit, and customer SSE.
- **E06 staff access:** JWT auth, refresh-token rotation/revocation, RBAC guard,
  and staff account administration.
- **E07 kitchen:** queue/status transitions, sold-out toggle, staff restaurant
  SSE, and recently-served items.
- **E08-E10 operations:** cashier open tables/bill/discount/payment, admin CRUD
  for categories/menu items/options/tables/QR tokens, and admin reports.
- **Shared error catalog** (`src/shared/errors`) — one source of truth for error
  codes, messages, and HTTP statuses, surfaced through the standard envelope.

Deferred follow-ups are tracked in `docs/stories/backlog.md` and story validation
notes, including menu search, dish detail/option-selection UI, customer live
status UI, call-staff/request-bill, CSV export, and scale-oriented report indexes.

## Running The App

Requires Bun ≥ 1.3 and a Neon (or any Postgres) `DATABASE_URL`.

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env          # then set DATABASE_URL (use sslmode=verify-full)
bun run dev                   # watch mode; GET /api/health -> { data: { status: "ok" } }
```

Common scripts:

```bash
bun run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
bun run lint        # oxlint src test
bun run format      # prettier --write
bun test            # bun test
bun run db:generate # drizzle-kit generate (migrations land from US-002)
bun run db:migrate  # apply migrations
```

Git hooks (Husky) run on commit: `pre-commit` formats/lints staged files via
lint-staged, and `commit-msg` enforces Conventional Commits via commitlint.

### Stack

- **Backend:** Elysia (Bun), Clean Architecture (`domain` / `application` /
  `infrastructure` / `presentation`, plus a `shared` kernel).
- **Database:** Neon serverless Postgres via Drizzle ORM on the `node-postgres`
  driver (chosen so the realtime broker can hold a persistent `LISTEN/NOTIFY`
  connection).
- **Auth:** in-house JWT access token + DB-stored revocable refresh token.
- **Realtime:** SSE from Elysia sourced from Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`.

Rationale and risk gates: `docs/decisions/0008-restaurant-qr-architecture.md`.

## Product Sources

The product contract is derived from `SPEC.md` and lives as smaller living
artifacts:

- `SPEC.md`: the seed input spec for the first buildout.
- `docs/product/`: product contract files (overview, data model, API
  conventions, auth, and per-domain docs).
- `docs/stories/`: story packets (`epics/`) and the backlog.
- `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`: behavior-to-proof control panel.
- `docs/decisions/`: durable decisions and tradeoffs.
