# Auth & Authorization

Covers EPIC 8. Built in-house on the backend. **High-risk domain** — auth and
authorization are hard gates; behavior changes require a decision record.

## Identity

- Only staff (`ADMIN`, `KITCHEN`, `CASHIER`) authenticate. Customers never log in;
  they are authorized by table `qr_token` only.
- Passwords hashed with argon2 (preferred) or bcrypt. Never store or log plaintext.

## Tokens

| Token | Lifetime | Storage | Contains |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Access (JWT) | ~15 min | stateless, not stored | `userId`, `role`, `restaurantId`, `exp` |
| Refresh | ~7–30 days | DB `refresh_tokens`, hashed, revocable | opaque |

- Access tokens are signed with `@elysiajs/jwt`. Verified on every staff request.
- Refresh tokens are stored as `token_hash` so a DB leak does not expose usable
  tokens.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | none | email + password → access + refresh token |
| POST | `/api/auth/refresh` | refresh token | issue new access token; revoked → 401 |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | refresh token | mark refresh token `revoked = true` |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | access token | current user profile + role |

### Login (US-8.1)

- Verify email is active (`is_active = true`) and password matches the hash.
- On success return access token + refresh token; record the refresh token row.
- Invalid credentials → `401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS` (do not reveal which field failed).

### Refresh (US-8.2)

- Look up the presented refresh token by hash; reject if missing, expired, or
  `revoked`. Return `401 TOKEN_REVOKED` / `TOKEN_EXPIRED`.
- Rotate on every refresh: revoke the presented token and issue a new one with the new
  access token (decision 0010).
- Reuse detection: presenting an already-rotated (`revoked`) token signals theft → revoke
  the user's whole refresh-token family and return `401 TOKEN_REVOKED`.

### Logout (US-8.3)

- Revoke the corresponding refresh token. Idempotent: revoking an already-revoked
  token still returns success.

## Authorization (RBAC)

`authGuard` middleware verifies the JWT, attaches `{ userId, role, restaurantId }` to
context, and enforces role per route group:

| Role | Allowed surfaces |
| --- | --- |
| `ADMIN` | full: menu/table/staff CRUD, reports, all staff screens |
| `KITCHEN` | kitchen board + item status only |
| `CASHIER` | cashier/billing + service requests only |

- Wrong role → `403 FORBIDDEN`. Missing/invalid token → `401`.
- Tenant scope: every staff query is filtered by `restaurantId` from the token; a
  user may never read or mutate another restaurant's data.
- Customer (QR) routes skip the guard entirely and are authorized by `qr_token`.

## Staff Account Management (US-8.4)

- `ADMIN` manages staff within their own restaurant (US-010), via `/api/staff`:
  - `GET /api/staff` — list staff (tenant-scoped; never another restaurant's users).
  - `POST /api/staff` — create staff with email + initial password (hashed), name, role → `201`.
  - `PATCH /api/staff/:id` — update name and/or role.
  - `PATCH /api/staff/:id/active` — activate/deactivate.
- `restaurantId` always comes from the admin's token claims, never the request body.
- Deactivating a user (`is_active = false`) revokes all their refresh tokens, so existing
  sessions can no longer refresh.
- The last active `ADMIN` of a restaurant cannot be demoted or deactivated
  (`409 LAST_ADMIN`), so a restaurant is never left without an administrator.
- Errors: `409 EMAIL_TAKEN` (duplicate email), `404 USER_NOT_FOUND` (incl. another
  restaurant's id — existence is not revealed), `409 LAST_ADMIN`, `403 FORBIDDEN`
  (non-admin). Responses never include `password_hash`.

## Validation Shape

| Layer | Proof |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | password hashing/verify, JWT sign/verify, refresh-token hashing, guard role logic |
| Integration | login → refresh → logout flow against DB; revoked token rejected |
| E2E | staff logs in, reaches only the allowed screen, is blocked from others |
